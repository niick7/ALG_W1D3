Question 1. Write an algorithm beautiful(A, n)
Input : An integer array with n elements
such that the best case running time is equal to the worst case running time. Write the algorithm and
give your analysis to justify your claim.


Question 2. Order them based on their complexity.
2^n , 2^(2n), 2^(n + 1), 2^( 2^n ) (Note: ^ stands for exponent operation. Example: 2^n = 2n )


Question 3. Mention one algorithm you know for each of the time complexities listed.
O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n^3), O(2^n)
Example. O(n log n) : Quicksort


Question 4. Apply Master Theorem and determine the time complexity of
(a) fib(n) shown in slide 48.
(b) binSearch shown in slide 41


Question 5. Practice Master theorem. It is a very important result in Analysis of algorithms. There are
many resources on the internet. Show three different examples covering three possible cases. Show
your detailed work.
